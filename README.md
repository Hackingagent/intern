Student users can see the all uploaded internship and job vacancies in the web system. They can apply for the vacancies and add vacancies for the favorite section. Also students can see more details about a specific vacancy and its company details. Students can remove vacancies from the favorite section. If a student apply for a vacancy, he/she can message with the company that posted the relevant vacancy.
